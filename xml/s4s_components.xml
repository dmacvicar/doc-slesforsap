 <para>
  As depicted in <xref linkend="fig.s4s.offering"/>,
  &sles4sap; is based on &sls; but contains several additional
  software components such as &sleha;,
  the kernel page-cache limit feature, and the installation
  workflow. These software components are briefly explained in the
  following sections.

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.s4s.component.page-cache">
  <title>Page-Cache Limit</title>
  <para>
   You can limit the kernel file system cache size to influence swapping

 <sect2 xml:id="sec.s4s.component.clamsap">
  <title>Antivirus Protection with ClamSAP</title>
  <para>
   ClamSAP integrates the ClamAV antivirus toolkit into &netweaver; and
   &sap; Mobile Platform applications to enable
   cross-platform threat detection.
   For example, you can use ClamSAP to allow an &sap; application to scan for
   malicious uploads in HTTP uploads.
   ClamSAP can be installed from the package <systemitem>clamsap</systemitem>.
   To use virus scanning within &netweaver;, you need to enable it there
   (<menuchoice><guimenu>Transaction</guimenu>
   <guimenu>VSCAN</guimenu></menuchoice>).
  </para>
  <para>
   ClamSAP is a shared library that links between ClamAV and the

   <title>Firewall for &hana;</title>
   <para>
    &hana; often requires more firewall zones than the standard installation of
    &susefirewall; provides. For this reason, &sles4sap; additionally
    provides the package <systemitem>HANA-Firewall</systemitem> which
    integrates with &susefirewall;. It contains preconfigured zone setups and
    rules to make securing &hana; as simple as possible.

    Calling a Guide "software" is a bit of a stretch... But it is not really a

     Packages May Be Missing from Patterns

    <para>
     The selection of packages of the software patterns are defined while a
     specific release (Service Pack or major version) of &sles4sap; is
     developed. This package selection is stable over the lifetime of this
     particular release. When working with &sap; applications that have been
     released more recently than your &sles4sap; version,
     dependencies can be missing from the patterns.
